Brave Tower is a turn based dungeon crawler coded where the player traverses up a tall tower in order to steal treasure from a ferocious beast. All of the animations and images are original and created on pixelartsolely for this game. The player and the enemies travel based on a coordinate system. The player is able to travel two spaces in any direction laterally. Like chess, if an enemy is within the range of the player, the player can click on the enemy to kill them. In addition, if the player faces the enemy while the enemy attacks them, they can block the attack up to three times. There are a total of 8 enemies and a boss in the game. Each enemy has their own unique ability. For instance, the mirror enemy will switch spots with the player if the hero is within its line of site. The enemies will always choose a path that will bring them closer to the player as their main goal is to kill the hero. In addition, players will also have to worry about their environment as there are deadly spikes on the ground. Players who successfully exit the tower with the loot will have their time recorded and displayed in the end screen if their time is one of the top five fastest times.
